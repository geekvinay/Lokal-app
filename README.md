# Lokal-app


## Installation
I've made this template using Vite js. It is a front-end tool that is present in npm. 
> Why did I use Vite? 
I've used [VITE](https://vitejs.dev/)  because of the speed it provides.

```bash
# clone the repository onto your local machine.
git clone "address of the repository"

# Go/Open the repository
cd vite

# Install all the dependencies
npm  install

# Run a developer server to view the output
npm run dev
```
